% some very useful LaTeX packages include:

%\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format
                        % of the cite.sty package \cite{} output to follow
                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/cite/

\usepackage{graphicx}   % Written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz
                        % Required if you want graphics, photos, etc.
                        % graphicx.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version and documentation can
                        % be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
                        % Another good source of documentation is "Using
                        % Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl
                        % which can be found as esplatex.ps and epslatex.pdf
                        % at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/

%\usepackage{psfrag}    % Written by Craig Barratt, Michael C. Grant,
                        % and David Carlisle
                        % This package allows you to substitute LaTeX
                        % commands for text in imported EPS graphic files.
                        % In this way, LaTeX symbols can be placed into
                        % graphics that have been generated by other
                        % applications. You must use latex->dvips->ps2pdf
                        % workflow (not direct pdf output from pdflatex) if
                        % you wish to use this capability because it works
                        % via some PostScript tricks. Alternatively, the
                        % graphics could be processed as separate files via
                        % psfrag and dvips, then converted to PDF for
                        % inclusion in the main file which uses pdflatex.
                        % Docs are in "The PSfrag System" by Michael C. Grant
                        % and David Carlisle. There is also some information
                        % about using psfrag in "Using Imported Graphics in
                        % LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which documents the
                        % graphicx package (see above). The psfrag package

%\usepackage{subfigure} % Written by Steven Douglas Cochran
                        % This package makes it easy to put subfigures
                        % in your figures. i.e., "figure 1a and 1b"
                        % Docs are in "Using Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e"
                        % by Keith Reckdahl which also documents the graphicx
                        % package (see above). subfigure.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version

\usepackage{url}        % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % Provides better support for handling and breaking
                        % URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

%\usepackage{stfloats}  % Written by Sigitas Tolusis
                        % Gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column
                        % floats at the bottom of the page as well as the top.
                        % (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally
                        % possible in LaTeX2e). This is an invasive package
                        % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e output
                        % routines. It may not work with other packages that
                        % modify the LaTeX2e output routine and/or with other
                        % versions of LaTeX. The latest version and
                        % documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/sttools/
                        % Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty
                        % comments as well as in the presfull.pdf file.
                        % Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as
                        % IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch.
                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE
                        % does not format its papers in such ways.

\usepackage{amsmath}    % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands
                        % for dealing with mathematics. Note that the AMSmath
                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.

% Also of notable interest:
% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart {B}{lockchain} and bitcoin are both hot topics these days. Bitcoin is a distributed, decentralized crypto-currency. A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Bitcoin uses the blockchain protocol to serialize transactions of the bitcoin currency among its users. Figure 1 is an image briefly introducing how blockchain works for bitcoin.

		\caption{an image briefly introducing how blockchain works for bitcoin}
		\label{fig:how_blockchain_works}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}

\section{Motivation}
This is a learning project during which we want to mock and visualize the bitcoin blockchain.
\section{Gap}

	% You can reference tables and figure by using the \ref{label} command. Each table and figure needs to have a UNIQUE label.
	Figures and tables should be labeled and numbered, such as in Table~\ref{tab:simParameters} and Fig.~\ref{fig:tf_plot}.

	% This is how you define a table: the [!hbt] means that LaTeX is forced (by the !) to place the table exactly here (by h), or if that doesnt work because of a pagebreak or so, it tries to place the table to the bottom of the page (by b) or the top (by t).
	\begin{table}[!hbt]
		% Center the table
		\begin{center}
		% Title of the table
		\caption{Simulation Parameters}
		\label{tab:simParameters}
		% Table itself: here we have two columns which are centered and have lines to the left, right and in the middle: |c|c|
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			% To create a horizontal line, type \hline
			\hline
			% To end a column type &
			% For a linebreak type \\
			Information message length & $k=16000$ bit \\
			\hline
			Radio segment size & $b=160$ bit \\
			\hline
			Rate of component codes & $R_{cc}=1/3$\\
			\hline
			Polynomial of component encoders & $[1 , 33/37 , 25/37]_8$\\
			\hline
